        <h4>20th March 2020: No masses until further notice</h4>
        Further to the offical advice from the UK Government on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is with regret that <strong> as of Friday 20 March</strong>, there will be no further Masses, services and group meetings at Our Lady of Dolours Church.
        <strong>The church will be open for private prayers.</strong>
        <br></br>
        We will be assessing the situation closely, and will re-celebrate Masses and regular services when official advice deems it appropriate for us to do so.
