                The goverment has announced widespread easing of lockdown restrictions, effective from the <strong>4th July</strong> and this
                easing applies to gatherings for Mass. While we are all keen to see the return of regular Masses as soon as possible,
                the logistical problems are involved are difficult.
                We are working hard behind the scenes, and are waiting on guidelines from the Diocese and so we cannot say exactly when, on or after this date, Masses will resume.
