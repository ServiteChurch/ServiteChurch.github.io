        <h1>Catholic Schools</h1>
        The archdiocese of Westminster is blessed with many very good quality catholic schools, both primary and secondary. Refer to
        <a href="https://education.rcdow.org.uk/find-a-school/">this site</a> for information about schools.
        <h2>Certificate of Catholic Practise</h2>
        <p>To apply for your child to attend a catholic school you will need to fill out a Certificate of Catholic Practice.</p>
        <p>
            a Certificate of Catholic Practice is a certificate issued by the family’s Parish Priest (or the Priest in charge of the church where the family attends Mass) in the form laid down by the Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales.
            This form will be signed by the Priest if they are satisfied that at least one Catholic parent or carer (along with their child, if he or she is over seven years old) have (except when it was impossible to do so) attended Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation for at least five years (or, in the case of a child, since the age of seven, if shorter). It will also be issued when the practice has been continuous since being received into the Church if that occurred less than five years ago. It is expected that Certificates will be issued on the basis of attendance.
            A Certificate may also be issued by the Priest when attendance is interrupted by exceptional circumstances which excuse from the obligation to attend on that occasion or occasions.</p>
            
        <h4>Which Priest should complete the Form?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>	The child’s own Parish Priest (i.e. the Parish Priest of the Parish in which the child’s family lives)
                <br />
            Or</li>
            <li>	The Parish Priest of the Parish where the child’s family fulfils its obligation (if different)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>  Parents should fill in the top part of the form with their details and then take the form to their Parish Priest 
              (or the Priest at the Parish where they normally worship) for signature.
              The priest will only sign this form if he knows you and agrees that you are a practising Catholic family.</p>

           <h4>printing your forms</h4>
        <p>A pro forma form that you need to print out and fill in can be found <a href="https://www.catholiceducation.org.uk/guidance-for-schools/admissions">here.</a></p>
