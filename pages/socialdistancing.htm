        <p>The church has now resumed celebrating Masses.</p>
        <p>
            Welcome back to our church.It is good to see you but for your own safety and
            for everyone else as well, please keep to these
            simple rules. Please be patient as we learn to observe the new guidelines.

        </p>
        <p>
            We will need to observe track and trace. Each time you come to Mass you will need to
            leave your name and contact number (phone or email) and time and date. We need to keep
            this information for 21 days.
