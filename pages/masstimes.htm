        Details of which masses will be celebrated are yet to be determined.

                The church will now be open daily for private prayer between <strong>10am and 12.30pm.</strong>.
                See <a href="socialdistancing.htm">here</a> for details.

            We will be assessing the situation closely, and will re-celebrate Masses and regular services when official advice deems it appropriate for us to do so.
