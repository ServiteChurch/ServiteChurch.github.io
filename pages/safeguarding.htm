        <p>
            The Episcopal Vicar for Safeguarding and the Safeguarding Co-ordinator are responsible for the planning and monitoring of all aspects of vulnerable groups work within the Diocese, with the exception of schools. This involves responding to any allegations past or present, of inappropriate behaviour or actual abuse of children or vulnerable adults by any person working for the Diocese, either paid or voluntary, and liaising with the police and social services. It also involves promoting and implementing the National Policies for Child Protection or the Protection of Vulnerable Adults which have been adopted by the Diocese.
